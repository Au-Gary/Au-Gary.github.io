# Some Desmos Demonstrations for Introductory Math/Stats Courses

Here are some of the Desmos demonstrations I've used in my classes. I'll simply link to most of them, and embed a few that are my favourites :)

They are loosely grouped in the following categories:

- [Pre-Calculus](#pre-calculus)
- [Differential Calculus](#differential-calculus)
- [Integral Calculus](#integral-calculus)
- [Probability](#probability)
- [Others](#others)

Please feel free to adapt them for your own use. If you have any questions/comments/bug reports about these demonstrations, or would simply like to let me know that you find them useful, please feel free to e-mail me at `Pau@mathQ.usask.caR` (with P,Q, and R removed).
