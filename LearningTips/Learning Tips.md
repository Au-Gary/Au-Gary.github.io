# Learning Tips

In Fall 2025, I spent the first 3–5 minutes of each class discussing a learning topic with my students — things I wish someone had told me as a first-generation university student.

Below are the slides I used in class. If time permits, I’ll convert these into short videos.

Please feel free to adapt them for your own use. If you have questions/comments/corrections, or would simply like to let me know you find them useful, e-mail me at `Pau@mathQ.usask.caR` (with P, Q, and R removed).

## Start Here If…

Start with the first link in a path; each takes ~2–5 minutes to read. 
Don't try to fix everything at once — most students do best focusing on one or two issues at a time.

- **I’m behind / overwhelmed** → [Prioritize] → [To‑Do Lists] → [Procrastination] → [Habits]
- **I study but don’t retain** → [Spaced Retrieval] → [Declarative vs Procedural] → [Cramming] → [Test Prep]
- **I panic during tests** → [Test Prep] → [Sleep] → [Stress] → [Test‑Taking]
- **I don’t know how to learn math** → [Getting Stuck] → [Visualization] → [Abstraction] → [Error Detection]
- **I don’t ask for help / feel stuck alone** → [Seek Help] → [Group Study] → [Self‑Sufficient] → [GenAI]

Paths are suggestions — feel free to jump to whatever is most relevant to you today.
